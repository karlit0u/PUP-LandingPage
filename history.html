                <p>
                    The Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Santa Rosa is  blessed to be in a city with more than 200 years of history, the Lion City of the South, officially known as Santa Rosa City in the province of Laguna. 
                    Santa Rosa was named after its patron  Saint Rose of Lima of Peru, when it was initially established as municipality in January 18, 1792.  
                    Santa Rosa City has witnessed and stood the test of times from the Spanish Period to the present day political era. It has also proven its resilience and generosity during the Covid 19 pandemic.   
                    And during the growth of the city PUP Santa Rosa was born  with the goal  of providing quality public education to mold the mind , heart and hands of the young people of Santa Rosa.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    On February  21, 2003 Municipal Mayor, Hon. Leon C. Arcillas signed a memorandum of agreement with Polytechnic University of the Philippines through University  President, Dr. Ofelia M. Carague.
                    This historic occasion was the beginning of  quality public tertiary education  in Santa Rosa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, the Campus  offered  courses in Information Technology (BSIT), Education (BSE), and  Entrepreneurial Management (BSEM) at the undergraduate level.   
                    For graduate studies the Master in Educational Management (MEM)  Open University System was introduced to cater to the needs of  those teachers in elementary and secondary schools in the City of Santa Rosa  and nearby towns who would like to pursue higher education.

                    The PUP Santa Rosa  is proud to have above average passing rate in board exams, for passing the various compliance processes to ensure the quality of education in the University.  
                    There are  many things yet to be done  but with the unwavering support from the Honorable Members of the Santa Rosa City Council  headed by our beloved City Mayor, Hon. Arlene B. Arcillas,  
                    PUP-Santa  will continue to share the responsibilities of delivering quality education and achieve the vision to become “The Country's 1st Polytechnic U.”

                    PUP-Santa Rosa is also proud to brave one of the pioneers to rise from the ranks in the person of Dr Leny V. Salmingo, 
                    a holder of PhD in Educational Management, from administrative assistant to now Campus Director from 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PUP Santa Rosa definitely grew and expanded over the decade. The increasing number of graduates and the very good percentage of passers in the board and licensure examinations made PUP Santa Rosa as one of the performing campuses of the University. 
                    There are many things yet to be done to integrate the functions of the academe such as sustaining the quality of instruction, nurturing the culture of research, extension, and production services, and enhancing the organizational performance, and reaching out to the alumni of the Campus. 
                    With the unwavering support from the Honorable Members of the Santa Rosa City Council headed by our beloved City Mayor, Hon. Arlene B. Arcillas, we firmly believe that PUP will continue to share the responsibilities of delivering quality education in the City of Santa Rosa as we help more students build their dreams into reality, and become more responsible citizens.

                    This development plan, which is in line with the Institutional Plan of the University, 
                    highlighted the commitment of the faculty and staff and the need to review policies and strategies to improve existing performance of the Campus as we strongly face the challenges of stability and excellence in the coming years and help the University President clear the path and lay new foundations to transform PUP into its tagline “The Country's 1st Polytechnic U”
